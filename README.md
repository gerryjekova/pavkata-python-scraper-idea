# pavkata-python-scraper-idea
Will try to build a scraper and do the assignment from Pavkata's stream that I missed today. :D Unfortunately it has to be done with Python, which is discouraging to me... The other thing that scares me is that I have to 'develop' an API and I still am unable to generally comprehend what it means to make an API, even though I have done it in Java..
